Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: First Come First Serve


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1278.5 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480 ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?

I completed both parts for extra credit.


Exercise 5:

Process 4 had the first interrupt since it did not finish outputting its text.

Extra credit exercises:

For exercise 7, I implemented a multilevel queue. There are NPROC queues labeled
0 to NPROC-1. The processes in each queue are determined by the process priority
levels. Queue 0 is implemented as round robin and the rest are FCFS. Processes on
higher priority queues will be run before the lower priority ones.
